              <p>The country’s dollar reserves climbed to a seven-month high of $82.066 billion in May partly on the back of higher gold prices as well as inflows from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) investments overseas.<br>
              The gross international reserves (GIR) level last month was the highest since the $85.106 billion recorded in October last year but lower than the $82.927 billion registered in May last year, the preliminary BSP data released Wednesday night showed.<br>
              In a statement, BSP Governor Amando M. Tetangco Jr. attributed the month-on-month reserves buildup to “inflows arising from the net foreign currency deposits by the national government, income from the BSP’s investments abroad, and revaluation adjustments on the BSP’s gold holdings resulting from the increase in the price of gold in the international market.” <br>
              “However, these were partially offset by the BSP’s foreign exchange operations and payments made by the national government for its maturing foreign exchange obligations,” Tetangco added. The peso remained at the 49:$1 level last month. <br>
              The end-May GIR can cover 9.1 months’ worth of imports of goods as well as payments of primary income and services. <br>
              The dollar reserves level as of May were likewise equivalent to 5.3 times the short-term external debt based on original maturity, as well as 3.7 times based on residual maturity.</p>
